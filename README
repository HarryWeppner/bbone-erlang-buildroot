Buildroot for the BeagleBone - Erlang Version
=============================================

This README contains basic instructions for creating a system image
for the BeagleBone using Buildroot. The image created is minimal, boots
quickly, is fairly small, but doesn't do much. Packages can easily be
added using Buildroot's "make menuconfig" configuration editor. 

Preparing your system
---------------------

Buildroot requires several packages to be installed on the system 
before it can work. On Ubuntu, the following apt-get line is sufficient:

sudo apt-get install git-core bison flex g++ gettext texinfo libncurses5-dev

Building
--------

First, tell buildroot which configuration to use:

make beaglebone_erlang_defconfig

To build everything, run:

make

The initial build takes a while since many packages need to be downloaded and 
built. The downloads are cached in the dl directory. Subsequent builds are
faster.

The build output is stored in the output/images directory.

Creating a BeagleBone MicroSD card
----------------------------------

After the build completes successfully, run the create_sdcard.sh script to
format a MicroSD card for the BeagleBone. While it certainly doesn't need
to be this large, I currently use 4 GB MicroSD cards and the script
makes that assumption. Large cards should work fine.

Since the create_sdcard.sh script formats the card, be very careful with
it to avoid losing data. It fails if you specify a disk that is currently
mounted.


Updating the Root FS on the BeagleBone
--------------------------------------

The Root FS is configured to mount read-only on the BeagleBone. This is done 
to prevent data corruption from unsafe shutdowns and as a reminder that all
configuration and new packages have to end up in the buildroot configuration.

Since this can be annoying during debug, the rootfs can be mounted by running:

mount -o remount,rw /
