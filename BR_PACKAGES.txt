This document tracks which packages are included in the nerves-project
default build and the reasons for their inclusion. In the spirit of
buildroot, we aim to include a minimal set of packages so that the
resulting images are small, but useful. It should be possible for a
beginner user to come up quickly and get simple apps to work. Every
application, peripheral or feature does not need to be enabled, since
buildroot lets users that need specific features to produce their
own image easily. Also, since builds are minimal, the hope is that
new users will be able to browse around the root filesystem and become
comfortable with it. They should not have to concern themselves with
complicated setups initially. For example, wireless LAN support can be
quite complicated for a new user when they deal with it on an embedded
system. Many users don't need this or the infrastructure they require,
but for those that do, we plan to document how to add it in a How To.

Enabled packages		Reason
----------------		------
erlang				If there were one package to enable...
Busybox				General Linux command line utilities
dropbear			ssh/scp
ethtool				Debug Beaglebone Ethernet PHY issue
				(remove when resolved)
rsync				Sync development files on the host
				with the Beaglebone
dialog				Board setup menus
uemacs				Lots of people like emacs
git				Develop on board (large package)
gcc				Develop on board (very large package!!)
strace				Debugging utilities (not large, but can be removed)

Formerly enabled packages	Reason
-------------------------	------
avahi				Errors on console, didn't work great.
				Probably not avahi's fault.
